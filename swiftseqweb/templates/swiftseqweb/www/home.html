                <p>SwiftSeq has been shown to reduce compute time by 4000x. It will also do your laundry and
                cook you dinner, so you have maximal time to dedicate to science.</p>

                language Taylor, it robustly executes, monitors, and paralellizes computational tasks.</p>
